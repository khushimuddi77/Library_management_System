Project Description: Simple Library Management System with Authentication

This project aims to create a simple library management system with a secure login feature for the librarian. The system utilizes linked lists to manage the books section and binary search trees (BSTs) to handle customer records. The primary goal is to efficiently manage library resources, handle book borrowing and returns, and ensure a secure login for librarian access.

Features:

Login Authentication:

Implement a secure login system where the librarian enters a username and password to access the system.

Books Section Management (Linked List):
Allow the librarian to add new books to the library with relevant information, such as title, author, genre, and availability status.
Provide the option to remove books from the library once they are no longer available.
Enable updating book details like availability status and other attributes as required.
Display the list of books, sorted or filtered by specific criteria, for easy book management.

Customers Management (Binary Search Trees):
Allow the librarian to add new customers to the system with essential details like name, contact information, and membership status.
Provide the option to remove customers from the system when necessary, while maintaining accurate customer records.
Implement efficient binary search trees to search and retrieve customer information quickly.
Borrowing and Returning Books:
